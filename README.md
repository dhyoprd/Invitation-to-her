# 💌 Project: The "Will You?" Invitation

A very special, digital letter written in code, just for her. This isn't just a website; it's the beginning of something beautiful. 💖

## ✨ The Magic Inside

*   **Floating Hearts**: A background that floats with love (literally, using Framer Motion!).
*   **The "No" Button**: It's a bit shy... try to click it and see what happens! (Spoiler: It knows "Yes" is the only right answer 😉).
*   **Our Song**: Press the music note 🎵 to play our special soundtrack.
*   **The Grand Plan**: A step-by-step reveal of our perfect date at **Jumeirah Akasa Bali**.

## 🛠️ Built With Love (and Tech)

*   **React + Vite**: Fast and smooth, just like how this date will go.
*   **Framer Motion**: Adding life, bounce, and smooth transitions to every interaction.
*   **Canvas Confetti**: Because saying "Yes" deserves a celebration! 🎊

## 🚀 How to Open

1.  **Install the love (dependencies)**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the magic**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  **Open the link** and get ready to smile!
